Welcome to ROOT2HDF5's documentation!
======================================


ROOT2HDF5 is a toolset for converting ROOT files to their HDF5 equivalent. At the moment (and possibly permanently), this only supports LArCV ROOT files.

Please be aware that unless you are familiar with the LArLite/LArCV toolset, this package will be difficult to use.
