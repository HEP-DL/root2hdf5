A Very Non-Generic ROOT File to HDF5 Converter


* Free software: GNU General Public License v3
* Documentation: https://root2hdf5.readthedocs.io.


Features
--------

Currently, this conversion only supports LArCV ROOT files to HDF5.

> NOTE: This requires both `ROOT` and `LArCV` to be installed. These are not managed by `pip`, and thus are not collected in `requirements.txt`.
